# Architectural Control System

There are two button stations, one at each side door, but none at the rear doors. These stations sync with each other and the booth. 

At each of these stations, the top button (labeled house lights) control the house lights. A blue light means on, and white means off. 
The bottom button turns preset one (set in the booth) on/off. Green is stage lights on, and no light is off. 

These stations can be locked to stop working through the touch screen box in the booth or on stage. 

The sconces are on a seperate system, which are on the touch screen box.
