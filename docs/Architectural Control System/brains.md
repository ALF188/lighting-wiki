Equipment rack
Top - pearidine architectural control processor - if an error a flashing red light front display will tell you
Below paridon - light system push dimmer button (on, off & dimer control) - red and white - has a weird second light 
outlets on the back, convenience receptacle on the front

New network - network-based (counsel, plug into the network to dmx)
The switch is the entire hub of the network if goes down loses everything but they are reliable

If nothing is working go to this rack - make sure has power, switch on, see activity, no error. 
Critical point in the system

Below that touchscreen control

Below that gateways - in network lighting control system used to convert network-based signal to dmx (what fixtures listen to)
2 gateways - each have 4 outputs - cartline going to each electric, 1-4 and catwalk, those locations have physical DMX outputs where lights plug into and have network output tied into the switch

One portable gateway - only needed if additional fixtures on electrics or catwalk and need more than a universe of data -  plugs into the network on the side and DMX out on the front

In drawer - have hard user manuals, not all devices have hard manuals, QR code on devices that dont have hard manuals - some spare equipment - patch cables, etc

Very bottom, ups lose rack - equipment is critical to the system - ups put in for short power outages (utility or local) ups leaves control equipment online, 30-60 mins of ups coverage - beep if the power does go out indicating ups has taken over

Rack hinges open in back - power source -->
