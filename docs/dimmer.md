#Dimmer Rack

You shouldn't mess a whole lot with the dimmer rack, but I've included notes from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDTiotuDgOk&ab_channel=ForensicsTeamSKZ) below.

###Dimmer Rack Information 
Dimmer rack on univers one
Dimmer rack - 48 circuit rack - recircuited
Everything has been relabeled - can be read from the floor 
Field - 6 circuits for each electric 1,2,&3
6 circuits for front house and catwalk
The new 4th electric has 2 circuits on it 
All field circuits controlled by relay modulus in a dimmer rack 

###In dimmer Rack 
48 circuits on 24 moduels 
circuit all 20amp 
Relay modulus yellow sticker any filed supercuts are 
dimmer modules no yellow sticker only house lights 
Circuit numbers left side - not in order - split by phases
No need to mess around, will all be remotely controlled
Are physical breakers on all modules- if overloaded the breaker will trip and needs to be reset after removing the load  - everything has been split out evenly on circuits overload shouldn't ever happen
Spare circuits future expansion - indicated by breaker off
outside the rack logo illuminated blue - if error it will blink 
Inside control, processers on bottom - control processers will identify errors on the front screen and tell you what the error is - contact the company or factory for help
The dimmer rack has a label on the front

Disconnect for dimmer rack (9:32) fused 200amps - no good reason to blow a fuse

Dust management - dust filter in front - push up & pull out - unidirectional, doesn't matter which way you put it back in - blow it out with compressed air, can wash it with water and mild detergent if needed 
2 or 3 months look at it - most likely only once a year
House lights on = fans on will turn off when lights are off

the device on top of the rack is a sound suppression hood
