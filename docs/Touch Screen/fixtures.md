#Fixture Control

- Front, back, and cyc light control faders control the intensity of each type of light
- House lights control all lights (apron, center, sides, and 4 corner entrances), but you can individually control all of them as well
- If the faders are not responding, make sure you have turned on the [relays](../relays)
