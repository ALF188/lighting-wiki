#Touch Screen



<!-- The screen will time out, just tap to turn it on, it will bring you to the slash screen (Platteville logo), press that to get to the navigational/home screen
Navigation screen - has basic functions and more advanced functions - house lights dimmer - time and date (very important for light schedule) - quick access to different pages and basic presets - house light presets are not recordable (full, half, 25%, out) active preset illuminated in blue, inactive not illuminated - presets(ABC) quick basic presets (not particularly intended to be used for a show or concert, can be used though) - system off button = all data and relays killed, no lights will work if the system is off
Navigation screen has an info button - has contact info
All pages have a home button that will take you back to the navigation screen and a help button (?) at top of every page will bring up a dialogue that can help you navigate the page you are on - there is a bottom bar that always shows the time, data, and house light dimmer -->
